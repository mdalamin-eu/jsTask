    <h1>Angular Js</h1>
    <p> AngularJS is an Open-source Front-end JavaScript-based framework that is maintained by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. AngularJS widely used to create Single-Page Applications, a web application or we can say a website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading the entire website from a server. 

        AngularJS is built on the belief that declarative programming should be used to create user interfaces and connect software components, while imperative programming is better suited to defining an application's business logic.[6] The framework adapts and extends traditional HTML to present dynamic content through two-way data-binding that allows for the automatic synchronization of models and views. As a result, AngularJS de-emphasizes explicit Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation with the goal of improving testability and performance.
        </p>
    <h2>Bootstrap</h2>
    <p>Bootstrap is an open-source Javascript framework developed by the team at Twitter. They Used HTML CSS JS for building user defined interface! 
        We can say it “Front-end-framework”. Bootstrap is a free collection of tools for creating a websites or web applications. There are lots of design templates and classes for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions.

    <h3>ReactJs</h3>
    <p>A JavaScript library for designing and developing the UI of websites and web apps is known as react js. It allows you to create interactive elements on websites.JavaScript is a scripting language that enables users to build and manage dynamic content on their websites (such as slideshows, animated graphics, interactive forms, etc.). For instance, When you hover your cursor on the ‘Courses’ button on upGrad’s homepage, a drop-down menu appears. That’s an interactive component, and you can build one through JavaScript.</p>

    <h4>Node.js</h4>
    <p>Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source back-end JavaScript runtime environment that uses the V8 engine to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Node.js allows developers to utilize JavaScript to create command-line tools and server-side scripting, which involves running scripts on the server before sending the page to the user's browser.</p>
